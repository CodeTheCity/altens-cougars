##Challenge

Brain sits on the board of the [Altens Community Center ][5] in Aberdeen. His
community center has lots of rooms that are available for the public to use. A
lack of volunteers makes it difficult to make full use of the rooms in the
center.

[Read extended challenges here][7]

##Result

We built a prototype system that will allow at a glance information for which
rooms are currently booked. To ease the burden of booking on the staff in the
center we have also prototyped a booking system. The system could be used from
the web or by the manager of the center.
