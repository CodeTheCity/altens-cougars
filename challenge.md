### Immediate

Rooms within the Community Centre setting are generally under utilised

Minimal and periodic admin resources are available to handle enquiries for bookings
The challenge is to allow some vetting of enquiries such that admin and managerial resources can be used for higher level tasks such as funding proposals

This project allows immediate real time access to room availability and subsequent general information to allow the potential user to determine the suitability of the space.

This makes the general information and conditions of booking available to users that they need prior to confirming a booking without requiring contact with administrative staff. This includes basic arrangements about accessibility, hospitality and equipment.

Having assessed this information, any provisional booking is likely to become a confirmed booking and thus provide a return for time invested by both parties.
 
### Longer term

This project looks a week ahead but there is potential for longer term and multiple bookings to be added at a later stage by incorporating use of the programme calendar via the Centre website.

Providing a link to the Centre programme and its associated links will provide some consequential advertising for the centre activities by including a ‘what’s on’ area.
 
### Further issues
 
Centre staff will require a simple method of transforming their building plans into the system

When a booking has been made an alert needs to be flagged up to admin staff
